1. Import data: "Header" option on the "Options" tab has to be enabled. I did not see that mentioned in the instruction and
spent 1.5 hrs to figure it out. Without setting this option, you will be getting error messages during the data import
saying that integer/date/numeric fields have invalid values.

2. In different places of the instruction I can see the company is named both "DrivenData" and "LeadData".

3. I'd like to have a requirements.txt file with all python deps listed.
